                            Halawa, Kohala is located on the island of Hawaii. My ancestors inherited this beautiful
                            ahupua’a and I wanted to create equally beautiful emblems to represent them. There are three
                            sets of designs created to represent three powerful men of Halawa, three powerful women of
                            Halawa, and Kaihe a Konohiki.

                        <p>Research began for my Hawaiian ancestry and I read through a book my father made for our
                            family, "Legacy of a Konohiki". I also talked to both my father and my grandma who knew more
                            about our ancestry. After my research, I started to sketch out some ideas for the design.
                            One of the challenges was to make the design look organic and natural through Illustrator. I
                            was later inspired by my professor about the woodcut or linocut art style and tried to make
                            something similar to it.</p>

                        <h3>Powerful Men of Halawa</h3>
                        <p>
                            The three taro plants were chosen to represent three of my ancestors; Kaihe, Paul Kahea, and
                            Akiona. Akiona had also worked as a taro planter. The two sugar canes around the emblem were
                            represented when Paul Kahea leased and/or sold land to James Wight for his sugar cane
                            plantation. The scenery of the land and ocean is to show that Kaihe and Paul Kahea are
                            watching over it as Konohikis. The three stems of the taro plants represented the rivers
                            north of the Kohala area. These rivers helped the warriors and families living there to have
                            clean water and food. The swirling waters branching away from the rivers can be seen as the
                            roots of the taro plant and the roots of the family tree expanding. The water can also
                            represent how the three of them were baptized.

                        <h3>Powerful Women of Halawa</h3>
                        <p>The 'Ohi'a lehua flowers were used to represent the three powerful women of Halawa; Kalama,
                            Nakookoo, and Ualani. All three of them were a Konohiki and managed the land, watching over
                            it. The scenery in this emblem is Halawa Kohala and one of its rivers running through the
                            land. Ualani was also born and buried in Halawa and her gravestone was found in the Tong Wo
                            Society. The sky was made to look like “heavenly rain” to represent Ualani’s name. The
                            valleys around the river were to represent how Kalama and Nakookoo acquired land after
                            giving their testimonies during the Great Mahele.

                        <p>
                            Kaihe’s name means casting spear, hence the triangular frame for his emblem as if to depict
                            the tip of a spear. The plant on the bottom is the Kauila plant. Its wood was often used to
                            create spears, javelins, daggers, kapa beaters, etc. The canoe was to show how Kaihe would
                            often travel between the different islands while following Kamehameha I. He was also a
                            Konohiki and watched over some land in Maui, Oahu, and Hawaii.
